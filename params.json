{"name":"LocalCacheLoader","tagline":"Adobe Air Local Cache Loader that will save on the file system and then retrive it from there ","body":"It is **Adobe Air** library written in **AS3** for caching content\r\n(swf,images,data file) to the local file system.\r\n    \r\nThe library is fully compatible with **Loader / URLLoader/ NetStream** and it try to replace a very light weight version of the browser cache.\r\n     \r\nBy using this class , the data of images text  and video will be fetch from server once and save locally , and then every time you will be request again we will check the local file system first and if the local file exists it will be use. \r\n     \r\n     \r\nAs a result , you can eliminate unnecessary communication to the server by requesting the same file over and over again.\r\n    \r\nThe usage is exactly the same as Loader / URLLoader /NetStream.\r\nThe main difference is that the initialization process that requires 3 Lines of code.\r\n\r\n        1. the fist is specified the application the main cache directory.<br>\r\n        2. is passing the  LocalCacheLoader, LocalCacheURLLoader, LocalCacheNetStream.\r\n        3. Using the factory to create instances for those classes. <br>\r\n     \r\np.s \r\nIt is not obligatory to use a Factory class to generate the local loader classes.    \r\n    \r\nHelp is needed!\r\n---------------\r\n        Help is needed for the NetStream loader it doesn't have the optimal solution it first save the\r\n        file to local disc and then play.\r\n        it will be perfect if it could buffer the stream and in end create file out of it.\r\n     \r\n    \r\n     \r\n## Code Example\r\nLet's look at an example even that it is quite easy to understand.
